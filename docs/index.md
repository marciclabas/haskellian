# Welcome to the Haskellian Docs!

Haskellian is a Functional Programming library for Python. It's main benefits are:

- **Zero import time**: modules are lazy-loaded
- **Static typing**: Haskellian makes deep use of typing and generics, giving you great IDE and type-checker support
- **Ergonomic**: Haskellian uses method-chaining style and strives for ergomonics over purity

```bash
pip install haskellian
```
